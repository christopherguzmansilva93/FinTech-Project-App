Project Create an App
Underlying problem: 
The problem that the app aims to solve is helping people save money towards a specific 
goal. That could be an expensive purchase, retirement account, downpayment for your 
first home or just an emergency fund. Many people struggle to save money and have 
difficulty saving their income towards their financial goals. About 35% of adults would 
have trouble covering a $400 emergency expense entirely with cash and would have to 
use a credit card or borrow money, according to a 2021 survey from The Federal 
Reserve. This leads to missed opportunities to purchase items they desire or save for 
retirement and may result in financial difficulties.
Business solution: The app will provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to set 
a goal amount and a percentage of their income to save towards their financial goal. It 
will also provide personalized budgeting plans and savings suggestions to help users 
reach their goal faster. 

Target market: The target market for the app includes anyone who wants to save 
towards a financial goal. The student body of CCNY that has difficulty staying on track 
when it comes to saving money. This can include young adults, professionals, and 
individuals with high-value purchases such as home, appliances, car, investments or 
savings. 

Business model: The app will be available for download on mobile platforms such as 
IOS and AndroidOS and will be free to download and use. The app will generate revenue
through advertisements, sponsorships, and partnerships with financial institutions and 
retail stores. It will also come with a premium service plan which provides the user with 
Ad-free experience and customizable badges.

Competitive advantage: The main competition for the app will be existing budgeting 
and saving apps, such as Acorns and Qapital. However, our app will offer a more 
personalized experience, with savings suggestions tailored to the user's specific goals and
budget. Additionally, the app will partner with retail stores to offer exclusive discounts 
and promotions to users who save towards a specific item. By offering a unique 
combination of personalized savings features and exclusive discounts, we believe our app
will stand out in the market and attract a loyal customer base. 

Owners/Staff: The owners will be responsible for the development, marketing, and 
management of the app. We’ll have staff of experienced software developers and 
financial advisors who have expertise in both technology and personal finance.
